models:

Learn different concepts from here:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/db/models/

Steps:
1 - Adding rest_framework in installed app.

2 - Creation of application within api directory:
        django-admin startapp appname

3 - registration of app in the installed app.

4 - Viewsets and views:

    Create view model in views.py which will be redirected or routed from urls. Use viewsets for this.

    https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/viewsets/#modelviewset

    from rest_framework import viewsets
    # Create your views here.

    class CategoryView(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
        queryset = Category.objects.all()  #.order_by('name')
        serializer_class = CategorySerializer

5 - model creation and registration.
    Create a model and register it in admin.py with admin.site.register(mode-lname)

6 - serializer creation.
    This is how, Category model is being serialized. In class Meta, model and required fields are mentioned.
    Fields name should be same to the model members or columns names defined in models.
    from rest_framework import serializers
    class CategorySerializer(serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer):
        class Meta:
            model = Category
            fields = ('name','description')

6 - url inclusion and router:
    This is how routers is added. You can also see the file. Moreover, routers from rest_framework is used for this.
        from rest_framework import routers
        router = routers.DefaultRouter()
        router.register(r"", views.CategoryView)
        urlpatterns = [
            path('', include(router.urls))
        ]
